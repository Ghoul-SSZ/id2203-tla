# ID2203 Distributed Systems, Advanced Course, TLA+ Project 2021

This repository contains some template code and useful readings to get started with the project. All the template code are placed in `src` and useful documents are placed in `readings`. Some introductory examples of PlusCal can be found in `readings/pluscal.pdf` while `readings/p-manual.pdf` is a good reference to look up  how the keywords and types works. A summary of TLA+ can be found in `readings/summary.pdf`. It contains a very useful translation from mathematical symbols to ASCII. It is not mandatory to read all of the documents but are useful for examples and quick look ups.

## Issues
If you find a bug please create an issue on git, or create a pull request with a fix.

If there are other questions, try to talk to the other students (e.g., in Piazza forums) and only if that doesn't help write me an email at <hng@kth.se>. Or, of course, ask at a lab session.
